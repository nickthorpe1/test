Explain how to perform a forensic analysis on a compromised host.	Collect and preserve evidence, analyze file systems and memory, look for malware signatures, review logs, and determine the attack vector and extent of the compromise.
What are some common evasion techniques used by malware, and how can they be detected?	Techniques include obfuscation, polymorphism, and rootkits. Detection involves behavior analysis, integrity checking, and using up-to-date anti-malware tools.
How do you detect and analyze obfuscated malicious scripts?	Use deobfuscation tools and techniques, analyze script behavior in a controlled environment, and look for known obfuscation patterns.
Describe the steps to conduct a root cause analysis of a security incident.	Identify the initial point of compromise, analyze how the attack was carried out, determine the extent of the damage, and implement measures to prevent recurrence.
How can machine learning be used in detecting anomalous behavior in network traffic?	Machine learning can analyze large datasets to identify patterns and detect anomalies that may indicate malicious activity. This involves training models on normal traffic patterns.
Explain the importance of logging and monitoring in detecting cyber threats.	Logging and monitoring provide visibility into system and network activities, helping detect suspicious behavior, track incidents, and provide evidence for investigations.
What are some indicators of a potential insider threat?	Indicators include unusual access patterns, data hoarding, sudden changes in behavior, and accessing sensitive data without a business need.
Describe the process of conducting a vulnerability assessment and penetration test.	A vulnerability assessment identifies security weaknesses, while a penetration test actively exploits these weaknesses to evaluate security posture. Both involve scanning, analysis, and reporting.
How would you handle a situation where a zero-day exploit is being actively used against your network?	Isolate affected systems, apply temporary mitigations, work with vendors for patches, monitor for additional attacks, and update security policies to prevent similar incidents.



Question  Expected Answer
What is threat profiling and why is it important in cybersecurity?	Threat profiling involves identifying and categorizing threat actors, their capabilities, intentions, and methods. It helps prioritize defenses and responses based on the specific threats an organization faces.
Explain the role of the MITRE ATT&CK framework in threat intelligence.	MITRE ATT&CK is a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It helps in understanding, detecting, and mitigating real-world cyber threats.
Describe the process of mapping an incident to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.	Identify observed adversary behaviors and match them to specific TTPs in the ATT&CK framework. This helps in understanding the attack lifecycle and planning appropriate responses.
How does the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis contribute to threat profiling?	The Diamond Model focuses on four core features: adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim. It helps in systematically analyzing and understanding the components and context of an intrusion.
What is threat scoring and how is it utilized in threat intelligence?	Threat scoring quantifies the risk associated with specific threats based on their severity, likelihood, and impact. It helps prioritize responses and allocate resources effectively.
Explain how the Cyber Kill Chain model is used in understanding cyber threats.	The Cyber Kill Chain outlines the stages of a cyber attack from reconnaissance to exfiltration. It helps in identifying and disrupting attacks at various stages of their lifecycle.
How can the MITRE ATT&CK framework be used to improve SOC detection capabilities?	By mapping detection mechanisms to specific ATT&CK techniques, SOCs can identify gaps, enhance existing detections, and develop new use cases to cover the entire attack lifecycle.
Describe the components of a robust threat intelligence methodology.	Components include data collection, threat analysis, dissemination of findings, and feedback loop. This ensures continuous improvement and relevance of threat intelligence efforts.
What is the significance of TTPs in threat intelligence and profiling?	TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) provide detailed insights into how adversaries operate. Understanding TTPs helps in anticipating and countering future attacks.
How does the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator tool assist analysts in their work?	The ATT&CK Navigator allows analysts to visualize and customize ATT&CK matrices for specific use cases, such as mapping defensive coverage or planning threat hunts.
Explain how threat intelligence feeds are integrated into SIEM systems.	Threat intelligence feeds provide real-time data on known threats. SIEM systems ingest this data to enhance detection rules, correlate events, and provide context for alerts.
What is the role of the Center for Threat-Informed Defense in cybersecurity?	The Center for Threat-Informed Defense collaborates with industry and academia to develop resources, tools, and research that enhance the practical application of threat intelligence.
