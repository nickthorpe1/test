• 50gr Flour
• 200gr Butter
• 3 Medium Eggs
• 150gr Dark muscavado sugar
• 100gr Demarera Sugar
• 1 Large Teaspoon Black Cocoa
• 1 Shallow Teaspoon Vanilla Essence
• 3 x 100gr Chocolate 70%
• 1 Flat Teaspoon Bicarb


• Ensure eggs are room temperature.
• Pre-heat oven to 195C
• Lightly grease a 20 to 25cm square tin and line it with baking paper.
• Mix both sugars while dry, and breakdown any lumps.
• In bambouree melt butter, chocolate and sugars together.
• Whilst the melting occurs, separately, add flour, cocoa and bicarb to a bowl and mix well.
• Add vanilla to the melted chocolate mix.
• Whisk the eggs to a fluffy, consistency. If they start to turn pale, you've overdone it.
• Add the melted chocolate to the egg and whisk some more.
• Quickly but delicately 'fold' in the flour and cocoa mix. (Not stir, blend etc)
• Pour the mixture to the earlier prepared tin and straight into the oven.
• Bake for 35 mins. Should gently rise during baking.
• Remove from oven, allow 10-15 min to cool, then remove brownie from tin... but leave in the baking paper.
• Allow an hour to further cool and firm.
• Enjoy.
