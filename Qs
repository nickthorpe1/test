Can you describe your experience with threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) and any specific tools you have used?

Response: Detailed experience with platforms such as ThreatConnect, Anomali, or MISP. Explanation of how they integrated these tools into their workflow and specific use cases.
How do you differentiate between various types of threat intelligence (strategic, operational, tactical, and technical)?

Response: Clear differentiation with examples. Strategic: high-level trends; Operational: immediate threats; Tactical: TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures); Technical: specific indicators (IOCs).
Can you walk us through your process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating threat intelligence?

Response: Step-by-step process including sources of data (open source, dark web, internal logs), analytical techniques (correlation, trend analysis), and dissemination methods (reports, alerts, dashboards).
Describe a significant cyber threat you identified and mitigated. How did threat intelligence contribute to this process?

Response: A detailed case study highlighting identification, analysis, mitigation strategies, and the role of threat intelligence in preempting or responding to the threat.
How do you prioritize and handle multiple threats or indicators of compromise (IOCs)?

Response: Explanation of prioritization criteria (severity, relevance, potential impact) and methods for handling concurrent threats efficiently.
What methods do you use to ensure the accuracy and relevance of your threat intelligence?

Response: Verification processes (cross-referencing sources, historical data analysis), relevance checks (contextual relevance to organization), and continuous improvement through feedback loops.
How do you keep up-to-date with the constantly evolving threat landscape?

Response: Engagement in continuous learning through industry reports, threat intelligence communities, conferences, webinars, and certifications.
Can you explain a time when you had to communicate complex threat intelligence to non-technical stakeholders?

Response: Example of simplifying technical details into business impact language, use of visual aids, and ensuring actionable recommendations.
How do you integrate threat intelligence into the overall cybersecurity strategy of an organization?

Response: Integration points (risk assessments, incident response plans, security controls), examples of strategic influence (policy changes, budget allocation), and alignment with organizational goals.
What role does collaboration play in your threat intelligence work? Can you give an example of a successful collaborative effort?

Response: Importance of internal (other security teams) and external (industry peers, ISACs) collaboration, and a specific instance where collaboration led to significant threat mitigation or insight.
How do you handle false positives in threat intelligence?

Response: Methods for identifying and reducing false positives (contextual analysis, whitelisting, tuning detection systems), and impact on overall threat landscape perception.
Describe your experience with automated threat intelligence tools and scripts. How have you utilized them in your previous role?

Response: Specific tools and scripts used (e.g., STIX/TAXII, Python scripts for data parsing), examples of automation improving efficiency, and any custom solutions developed.
What metrics do you use to measure the effectiveness of your threat intelligence program?

Response: Key metrics (detection rates, response times, false positive rates), how they inform decision-making, and examples of improvements driven by metric analysis.
Can you discuss a time when your threat intelligence led to significant changes in security posture or policy within your organization?

Response: Specific example, changes implemented, and the resulting impact on security posture or organizational policy.
What are some emerging threats you are currently monitoring, and how do you prepare for them?

Response: Current threat landscape insights, specific threats (e.g., new malware, APT groups), and preparation strategies (proactive measures, awareness programs).
